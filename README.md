# Raindrop Simulation
The main point of this task is to check if the number tested includes a 3, 5 or 7. If it includes these numbers as a factor then out would output "Pling", "Plang", "Plong" respectively.


A good example of this would be the number 10. The number 10 has factors of 1, 2, 5, 10, since a 5 is present in its factors it would output "Plang".

Another good example is the number 30, the factors of 30 include: 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30. Since there is a 3 and a 5 present in its factors, the output will be "PlingPlang".


## Different Files Created
In this project, 2 files were created. These files were raindrop_function.py and Test_for_code.py Here is a small description of the following files.

raindrop_function.py - Includes the function which checks for the factors and outputs the correct sound depending on the factors.
Test_for_code.py - This code includes a manual test, which shows different values and their output to check if it outputs the correct sounds.
