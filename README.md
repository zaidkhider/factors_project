# Raindrop Simulation
The main point of this task is to check if the number tested includes a 3, 5 or 7. If it includes these numbers as a factor then out would output "Pling", "Plang", "Plong" respectively.


A good example of this would be the number 10. The number 10 has factors of 1, 2, 5, 10, since a 5 is present in its factors it would output "Plang".

Another good example is the number 30, the factors of 30 include: 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30. Since there is a 3 and a 5 present in its factors, the output will be "PlingPlang".


## Different Files Created
In this project, 2 files were created. These files were raindrop_function.py and Test_for_code.py Here is a small description of the following files.

raindrop_function.py - Includes the function which checks for the factors and outputs the correct sound depending on the factors.
Test_for_code.py - This code includes a manual test, which shows different values and their output to check if it outputs the correct sounds.

## How to Test the code
To test the code, the user must open the terminal and run Pytest. This can be done by typing pytest into the terminal and hitting enter. The test will run will check to see if the tests fail or pass. If the user would like to test different values, this can be done by entering different values and seeing if they output either Pling, Plang or Plong or maybe combination of all of them.
